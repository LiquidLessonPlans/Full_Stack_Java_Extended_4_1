# Monitoring Tools

Monitoring is a process of reporting, gathering and storing data. Monitoring Microservices helps the organizations to -

* Understand the overall health of the application.
* Glean insight into the performance of each individual service that makes up an application.
* Ensure the API transactions are available and performing well.
* Isolate problematic transactions and endpoints.
* Optimize the end-user experience.

Some of the monitoring tools are:

* **Zipkin** - [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/?utm_source=thenewstack&utm_medium=website) is an open-source tracing system designed specifically to trace calls between microservices. It is especially useful for analyzing latency problems.
