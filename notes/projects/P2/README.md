# Project 2

## Description

Your next project will build upon the concepts from project 0 & 1, adding the following topics:
 - Angular 4
 - CI/CD
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Data

You will be building a client/server application with a frontend and backend. Your application will use a third party API to get data useful to the service you provide. What service that is, is up to you. Your team should consider your options and come up with an idea for a client/server application that can utilize a third party API to grab data. Your application should meet the minimum requirements set forth below. Your team will work with your trainer to create a series of user stories for your application's MVP.
  
You will be expected to complete the minimum viable product by the deadline and give a brief presentation demonstrating your project and answering questions from the audience.

This project will be done in teams of 5-6 members that will be assigned when we begin.

### Minimum Requirements
1. Proper use of OOP principles and a well layered application structure
2. Users are interfacing with an advanced UI built with Angular running in a browser
4. CRUD operations are supported for one or more domain objects via the web application's API endpoints
5. Client/Server communication is done with JSON in HTTP request and response bodies.
6. All low-level persistence logic is abstracted away with Hibernate/Spring Data
7. Documentation (all classes and methods have adequate Javadoc comments)
8. All Exceptions are caught and logged to a file
9. Data useful to the application is retrieved from a third party API
10. Adequate test coverage for the service-layer - choose at least one service layer class that has methods that make sense to test. Write a robust, valid test suite for that class attempting to achieve high % line coverage. Make sure to mock at least one object and intercept at least one method with your mock, and that can show that you understand unit testing well enough. 


### Bonus Features:
1. DevOps CI/CD pipeline is used to build and deploy project to a publicly available remote location


## Your App Here
You will need to write a small paragraph describing your application. It should be 4-6 sentences and briefly cover the important points and features.

### Minimum Viable Product
Your team will need to work with the trainer to come up with a satisfactory list of user stories for MVP as well as bonus stories. They should begin with "As a [stakeholder] I can... and describe what the user should be able to do. Aim for at least 2 different roles, user and administrator. Try to come up with 8 or so user stories for MVP. Carefully consider what your team can accomplish in 3 weeks and try not to set yourselves too great a task.

* As a user, I can see...
* As a user, I can purchase...
* As a user, I can check...
* As an administrator, I can schedule...
* As an administrator, I can cancel...
* As an administrator, I can view...

### Bonus Stories
* As an administrator, I can...

## Tech Stack

 - Spring Boot

## Deadline & Presentation
 - Finalized version of your project must be pushed to your team's p2 repository within the training originzation by 9:00 AM Central time on the date of the presentation showcase. Commits after that time will not be considered. The most recent commit submitted before that time will be the version of the project that is graded.
   - Presentation Showcase (Due Date): Wednesday, November 17th 2021, 9:00 AM CDT.
