# QC Questions on Angular
 - What is Angular?
   - Typescript based single page application UI framework, developed by Google, used to create dynamic web applications.
 - What are some differences between Angular and AngularJS?
   - Angular 2+ is TypeScript based, while original flavor is JavaScript based.
   - Angular 2+ is component based, while Angular is MVC based
   - Angular 2+ supports mobile devices better
 - What version of Angular are you comfortable working with?
   - Angular 2 was a major overhaul of the technology, and angular 4+ continues right up to version 13 which is current. We have been using the newest version of Angular, 13.
 - What is the latest released version of Angular?
   - Angular v13 was released November 2021.
 - What is the Angular CLI?
   - The command line interface that helps us create, configure, and initialize our Angular apps, modules, and components.
 - How can you create a new Angular project on the command line using the Angular CLI?
   - ng new <name>
 - How can you create a new component on the command line using the Angular CLI?
   - ng generate component <component-name>
   - or shorthand: ng g c <component-name>
 - What are components?
   - Components are the building blocks of Angular apps, and can be as big as a whole page, or as small as a single button or field. The @Component decorator denotes a component class which is a specialized type of directive that is always associated with a template.
   - Components are made up of 4 files created by the CLI:
     - template/view in the .html file
     - Stylesheet in the .css file
     - component in the .ts
     - unit tests in the .spec.ts file
 - What is an Angular module?
   - Angular modules contain metadata about one or more components, and are used to describe how the components should be built and injected. The module exposes and makes public components, pipes, directives, etc. And the module can import those things exported by other modules.
   - Angular is built to be modular, and a module is a container dedicated to a domain, workflow, or closely related set of features.
 - What is a directive?
   - A class that is used as a marker/attribute on a DOM element that allows us to manipulate the DOM.
 - What are examples of structural directives?
   - \*ngIf, \*ngFor, \*ngSwitch - note these all begin with a \*.
 - What are examples of attribute directives?
   - [ngClass], [ngStyle] - note that these are surrounded by []
 - Is a component considered a directive? Why or why not?
   - No, a directive is a class and is used inline as part of HTML elements. There is a component directive, but it is not an angular component. A directive is declared in a single .ts file, while components are described in at least 2 files, .html and .ts.
 - What are the different types of data binding supported by Angular?
   - one-way data binding: String interpolation, Property binding, event binding
   - two-way data binding: a mix of property binding and event binding.
 - What is interpolation? Is it different than property binding?
   - interpolation is where we inline the value of a string from our component into our template/view using {{ string }} syntax. This is different from property binding. Property binding can be used with non-strings.
 - What is event binding? Describe the syntax
   - Allows us to bind events such as keystrokes to a function in the component file. When these events occur, the data is sent to that funciton. This is one-way from template -> component.
 - What is two-way binding? Describe the syntax and name the directive required
   - Combining property and event bindings, we use the "banana-in-a-box syntax with the ngModel directive to achieve two-way binding.
 - What is a template?
   - A template is the file containing html that describes what the component will look like (AKA the view)
 - What is a decorator?
   - A decorator is similar to a Java annotation, it is a function that is used to alter classes, methods, parameters, etc. It is used with @FunctionName syntax.
 - How does routing work in Angular?
   - Routing is used to hide or display components in the DOM view, and is analogous in SPA to navigating around different HTML pages. We have an element <router-outlet> which displays those components that we route to. We use the anchor tag `<a>` to dentote a route, but use the routerLink attribute in place of href.
 - Where does the ngModel directive come from?
   - Angular's FormsModule, which we import in order to use ngModel.
 - What makes a “single page application” (SPA) different from a normal web page?
   - A single page applicaiton is front-loaded, as in all of the components and data are loaded at once, and we don't need to invoke any more loads to get to different parts of our application. A traditional web site has different pages, and as we navigate around we request each page one at a time. In SPA instead of viewing different pages, we simply hide and show different components as needed.
 - What is an Angular service?
   - An angular service is a class that is instantiated as a singleton object and exposes functionality to the components and modules to which is it provided. 
   - Good use cases for services in angular include: API consumption, inter-component/module communication, addressing cross cutting concerns
 - How can you create a new service on the command line using the Angular CLI?
   - ng generate service <service-name> AKA ng g s <service-name>
 - What are the properties of the metadata object passed to the @Component decorator?
   - template - used to write the template (html) code inline
   - templateUrl - used to point to a file containing the template code (html)
   - selector - indicates the element that can be used to nest this component in another template
   - styleUrls - used to indicate the file containing CSS styling for this component
 - What are the properties of the metadata object passed to the @NgModule decorator?
   - declarations - describe which components will be used in this module
   - imports - describes other modules whose functionality should be exposed to this module and it's components
   - providers - describes services that will be available to this module and it's component
   - bootstrap - describes the components needed to load the app-level module and root component - part of the initial bootstrap process
 - How are components registered to an Angular module?
   - CLI command: `ng generate component <directive-name>` registers components in the @NgModule decorated object, in the declarations array
 - How are directives registered to an Angular module?
   - CLI command: `ng generate directive <directive-name>` which registers these in the declarations array of the @NgModule decorated object.
 - How are services registered to an Angular module?
   - CLI command: `ng generate service <service-name>` which generates the files, which contain the @Injetable decorated object which tells angular where to expose the service
